# Distributed Display Protocol (DDP) in Golang
This package allows you to write pixel data to a LED strip over [Distributed Display Protocol (DDP)](http://www.3waylabs.com/ddp/) by 3waylabs.

## This Implementation is barebones and incomplete for now tested only with WLED.

This implementation is hugely based off of [ddp-rs](https://github.com/coral/ddp-rs). Big thanks to [Coral](https://github.com/coral).
